# Angle Calculation with ArUco & Sign Language Recognition

This repository contains code for two main projects:
1. **Angle Calculation using ArUco Markers** - Detects and calculates angles using OpenCV and ArUco markers.
2. **Sign Language Recognition with Smart Glove** - Uses sensor data to classify sign language gestures with machine learning.

## Features
- **ArUco-Based Angle Calculation:**
  - Detects ArUco markers in an image or video.
  - Computes the angle between markers for various applications.
- **Sign Language Recognition:**
  - Collects sensor data from a smart glove.
  - Trains and evaluates a machine learning model for gesture classification.
  - Includes various methods to preprocess the data.

## Future Improvements
- Improve gesture classification accuracy.
- Enhance real-time processing speed.
- Develop a user-friendly interface.

## Contributing
Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for enhancements and bug fixes.
